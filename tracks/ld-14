We will demonstrate some interesting interfaces and tricks the Linux kernel offers and how to use them to do various crazy things in the user space. Let's take a look at what actually goes on in the operating system when we start a program. What about communicating with PCI devices from the userspace or controlling processor pins? We will abuse signal handlers to start an .exe with an old DOS game in Linux process context and take a look at how to take over running processes with ptrace() and make them our minions. The attendees do not need to be kernel hackers or even know assembler, but at least cursory experience with C development in UNIX environment will be useful.
