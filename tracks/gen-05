Andrea will present the results of his Google Summer of Code (2011)
project, which he is still maintaining. This is a benchmarking suite
that is capable of comparing the performance and accuracy of
numerical libraries, even if it is modular enough to potentially
support every type of benchmark.
This suite makes use of the main Gentoo features -- in particular
Portage -- and during his talk he will present some of the advantages
of the Gentoo infrastructure  in the field of numerical computing
(but not only) related to the ability of fine-tuning and compiling
 every software present in the Portage tree and overlays.
