<p>There will be a keysigning event at the miniconf. It will happen on
Sunday at 13:30. It will be held at the Gentoo room, unless the number
of participants is too high. In this case we will move to the main
hall or even out in the street.</p>
<p>There is no central key registry for this keysigning. Instead it will
simply be a keyslip exchange.</p>

<p>What to bring:
<ul>
<li>Yourself</li>
<li>Paper slips with your key id, fingerprint, name & emails.</li>
<li>Something to identify yourself. Usually government-issued</li>
<li>identification, such as a passport. Multiple pieces of identification
are preferred.</li>
</ul></p>



<p>If you need to make new paper slips, this generator tool is suggested:

<p>At this time, there are 50+ attendees expected at the keysigning
event, so you should bring at least that number of slips. Doubling
that may be advisable if the event ends up being very large.</p>
