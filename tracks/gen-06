<p>The workshop will show how to use catalyst to create custom targets
for stages and ISOs. The talk will focus on 2 or 3 specific examples
that can be used as the basis for users to create their own custom
releases and present a configuration for catalyst to create.</p>
 
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The catalyst run takes sometime, so for users to be able to run
some tests, they must have a speedy box and allocate a few hours / a
day for the building. Instructions will be provided in advance for
users to configure theirs systems before the talk starts.</p>
