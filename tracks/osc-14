<p>The fdisk tool is perhaps the most recognized disk partitioner in the world, as it has historically been present in Windows and all Unix flavors. While this tool has proven useful and stable for its Linux variant, it as been subject to intense patching along its 20 years of existence, and it is a product of multiple authors, coding styles and concepts. Because of this, extending fdisk to keep up with modern day computing is hard, time consuming and error prone. To address this, during the past few months the fdisk program, part of the util-linux package, has been redesigned and updated to fit the requirements of a modern disk partitioning program. This talk intends to introduce users and developers to the new features that have been worked on (like a brand new API and GPT support) and what work lays ahead.</p>

<p>This work began as part of the Google Summer of Code 2012 program, with direct participation/collaboration from <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:GSOC_ideas#Redesign_fdisk_to_be_more_extensible_and_implement_GPT_support">openSUSE</a>. The project, now near completion, included designing and implementing a new API that aids creating disk partitioning tools (like fdisk, cfdisk and sfdisk) and adding EFI/GUID partition table support. Our work has opened the doors to a serious update of the fdisk-family, adding features that are nowadays paramount for any tool of this nature, including: removing CHS addressing, legacy DOS compatibility mode, driver-based label model, generic API for disk partitioning and GPT support, among others.</p>

<p>With this talk, users and developers can gain knowledge of what's going on with fdisk, current efforts and what will be done in the future, like UI enhancements and libfdisk.</p>
