CGroups is a modern linux kernel mechanism that allows grouping
processes, mass control of their resource usage and group isolation.
We will give a short cgroups introduction and describe the 'compctl'
framework that is used on workstations of one Czech university
department: it allows comfortable and considerate running of expensive
computations in parallel with regular workstation usage. An open
discussion on functionality and other interesting uses of cgroups
will follow.
