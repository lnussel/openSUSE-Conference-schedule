Today, openSUSE supports two distinct (and conflictig) approaches for the
configuration and management of network interfaces. You can either use
the "traditional" sysconfig based approach with the ifup/ifdown command
line utilities, or you can use NetworkManager. Both have their pros and
cons, but neither is really designed to cover all use cases well. At the
same time, we're faced with a lot of challenges, as the requirements on
network configuration get more complex. IPv6 has been around for a while
now, but doing it Right[tm] requires a much more flexible and dyamic
approach to interface management than we support today. Beyond that,
virtualization creates a whole new set of problems, with virtual
interfaces getting created and torn down on the fly, and with management
facilities like libvirt or openvswitch that are hard to reconcile with
either of the existing methods.

To address these issues, we would like to propose a unified, layered
management framework for network interfaces. Some code for this exists
today, and we are looking into getting this accepted for the next release
of openSUSE. We would like to use the talk to discuss the design with the
community, present the current state of the project and gather feedback
and suggestions.
