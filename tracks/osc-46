<p>systemd has been integrated and turned on by default in openSUSE 12.1. After the first set of integration bugs, systemd is becoming more and more stable in openSUSE.</p>

<p>What should we do next ?</p>
<ul>
<li>drop sysvinit ?</li>
<li>get packagers to write systemd native units to slowly initscripts</li>
<li>integrate latest systemd (with udev in the same package)</li>
<li>world domination !</li>
</ul>

<p>We might also discuss dracut (cross distribution initramfs generator) if time permit</p>
