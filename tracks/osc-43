Scanny is a Ruby on Rails security scanner developed largely as part of Google Summer of Code under openSUSE's umbrella. It parses application files and reports patterns in the code that could lead to security issues. This helps developers to create more secure applications. In the talk I will show how Scanny is used, what exactly it checks, how it works internally and how it can be useful to you.
