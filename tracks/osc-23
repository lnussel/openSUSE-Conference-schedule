<p>  Btrfs is generally considered the next generation filesystem
  for Linux.  Among its unique features are snapshots. We present
  two applications making use of btrfs snapshots:</p>

<p>  1. The new File Server Remote Volume Shadow-Copy Service
  Protocol (FSRVP) allows for the sharing and remote management
  of snapshots via CIFS/SMB. We aim to provide an overview of the
  protocol, as well as demonstrate a working FSRVP implementation
  using Samba.</p>

<p>  2. With snapper you can manage btrfs snapshots and restore your
  system or individual files. We will illustrate its
  functionality and present common use-cases.</p>
