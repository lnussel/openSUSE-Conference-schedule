I would like to introduce openSUSE KDE maintenance model, started from an brief introduction each of openSUSEâ€™s KDE repositories, how to apply to the rich KDE repositories, explanation of current maintenance status, such as what will happen after a new KDE SC / openSUSE version release; what I can do to help/contribute if I am an user and I want to contribute; how we would do when a request submitted to KDE repositories, and collect the feedback of what we can do to improve.
