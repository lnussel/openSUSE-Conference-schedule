<p>This technical paper explores the mobile printing unsolved problems, probable solutions and hashes out the conceptual printing models for future and some unrestricted ideas</p>

<p>Eliminate the printer specific driver on the work station or device and produce a printable data on the devices where print graphics is absent. The print rendering pipeline and the print sub system variegates across work station computers. And the need for the driver increases since the number of work stations are increasing and more importantly the graphics print quality varies across print sub systems. And in most of the mobile computing devices do not have the print rendering pipe line and the drivers associated to the printer. They are dependent on the external application and print rendering system for a quality print needs. In this paper, the solutions for the above mentioned unsolved problems are discussed and recommendations and proposals are made.</p>
