This talk will introduce the ownCloud project briefly which is a private cloud infrastructure for everybody easy to set up and use with perfect privacy. But quickly we will dig into more technical details: How file syncing, sharing and encryption in ownCloud works and what the OCS interface provides. And we will explore more gems an ownCloud comes with. Another spot will go on how other projects can interact with ownCloud as for example modern desktop environments will benefit from a tight cloud integration.
