To start this BoF session, Alex will give a rundown on the current
activities of the PR team and the German Gentoo e.V. registered
association (which is responsible for Gentoo's LinuxTag presences for
instance) and present his ideas on further improving our public
presence. Then, the audience is invited to give feedback and share their
ideas on our website, Social Media involvement, real-life events, and
anything else regarding our Public Relations.
