<p>As one of the guys operating the openSUSE maintenance processes, Marcus will give an overview and a technical look inside the currently lived openSUSE maintenance processes.</p>
<p>The update work flow at the project/package level within the openSUSE buildservice is similar to the OSC collaboration processes with the development projects, but not entirely so. Instead of development projects, the maintenance workflow uses so called incidents projects, where maintenance updates are prepared and staged and after successful preparation enter the review processes from the build and potentially the QA teams. These incident projects are self-contained and only build against released updates, making parallel work on updates easier and less error prone.</p>
<p>For the packagers only some process rules and methods change, like certain packaging requirements and using a "maintenance" branch instead of a regular branch checkout of the packages.</p>
