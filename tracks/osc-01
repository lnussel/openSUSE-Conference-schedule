<p>Many small charities are starved for funds and IT expertise. My small company fills that gap. This talk discusses the composition of a rather complete server based on OpenSUSE 11.4 with all open source components, plus a hot spare backup. Central to it is OpenLDAP as an identity store. Complicating internal matters is creating management interfaces for local users who are not IT specialists, and they have no Linux shell accounts. Clients are both local and remote, which means file access needs careful consideration, which we have done.</p>
<p>The discussed system has been in operation for over a year, with positive results.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is we can provide modern servers with a variety of useful applications, all from open source, but much careful thinking and design is needed to make this viable for users.</p>
