<p>I plan the talk as an introduction to Nix package manager and NixOS built upon it. First I shall explain its unique features such as safe non-root installations with automatic sharing, simultaneous presence of any number of version and configuration combinations, atomic and quick switches among them, and more. I will show how the properties are achieved and why it is necessary to break the standard filesystem layout to achieve them. The principles are then extended to whole-OS management, which allows to deploy systems from declarative configurations and switch among configurations both in GRUB or while running.</p>

<p>I expect more people not understanding Czech than those not understanding English. Therefore I plan the slides to be in English. I can talk both in English and Czech, I plan to let the listeners choose at the beginning. The talk can be longer than 20 minutes if desired but I believe it should be enough as the main point is bringing more people to our distribution's tiny community.</p>
