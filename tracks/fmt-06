Software is the invisible fairy dust that is sprinkled over today's 
society. It connects virtually everyone, everwhere and all the time. Yet its 
working are like dark magic to most people. And like dark magic, it holds 
power. Free Software developers are the white wizards of that world, freely 
teaching others about the power and control embodied in software. Georg Greve 
joined their ranks in the early 90s and will explain why this abstract is not 
totally crazy. No technical knowledge required.
