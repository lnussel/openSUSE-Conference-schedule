openSUSE Connect is kind of social network we use to store users personal information. It's not that social, but our goal is not to replace Google+, Facebook or Diaspora, but to store data needed by our infrastructure and provide people some extra friendly access to openSUSE project. Part of this years GSoC was to improve the current state of Connect and the talk will present Connect as whole as well as new features implemented as part of GSoC.
