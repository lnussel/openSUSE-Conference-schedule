<p>In 2006 Makezine, a magazine aimed at people who enjoy making all kinds of things themselves, came up with the owners manifesto. The manifesto was introduced as: “If you can't open it, you don't own it: a Maker's Bill of Rights to accessible, extensive, and repairable hardware.” The manifesto is a very practical statement aimed towards the manufacturing industry. Makezine and like-minded people want to be able to repair and tinker with products. In other words, make them their own.</p>

<p>In this presentation Bas van Abel takes one of Waag Society's latest projects, FairPhone, as a starting point to explore the invisible systems behind our products. From the conflicts around mineral mining in Congo to the business models that create closed and "designed for the dump" phones. By opening up a phone or any other product to the source, you open up the systems that make it into a product. You get to understand the actions that are needed to change these systems. Bas believes that this "ownership through opening" will catalyze more responsibility, both within the industry and within society.</p>
