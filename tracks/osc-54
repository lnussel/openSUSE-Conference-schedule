Recent X86 processors have sophisticated power management features
which can be influenced by the operating system, but are mostly
hidden. Deep sleep states have latencies which can affect interrupt
delivery timings significantly. Processor cores can be run at high,
overclocked frequencies under specific circumstances. CPUpower allows
to alter the behavior of these features. It can also be used to monitor
them and to better understand anomalies when measuring CPU or IO
perfomance of specific workloads.
