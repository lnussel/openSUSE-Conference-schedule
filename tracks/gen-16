Puppet is an open source central configuration management system.
In this workshop attendees will get to know its declarative language, and
how it operates, by doing simple tasks (create files, users, cronjobs),
setting up a server-client environment, and test it on multiple virtual
machines running different linux distros. The overall goal is to show all the
advantages on running puppet from a single laptop to a large datacenter.
Attendants are requested to have the puppet package installed in their
systems. As a side note, an unofficial Gentoo Puppet module will be presented.<br />
Participants are requested to have puppet installed in their system (Gentoo:
USE="vim-syntax" emerge -av puppet, openSUSE: zypper in puppet)
