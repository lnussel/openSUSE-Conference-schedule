<p>Clojure's interactive features provide programmers with a remarkable ability
to create software with a unique and highly responsive development process.
This can be seen to broadly similar to the differences between the waterfall
model and more recent agile approaches yet at an different timescale - that of
moments vs minutes, rather than days vs weeks. Programming with an approach
which allows one moment to flow frictionlessly to another without having to
wait for compile cycles gives the developer a unique workflow which will be
examined in detail in this session.</p>

<p>We will cover the art of Live Programming with Clojure, including elements
such as interactive editors, REPL sessions, realtime visuals and sound, live
documentation and on-the-fly-compilation whilst repeatedly demonstrating that
these techniques aren't just useful for artistic endeavours but also a
powerful and persuasive technique to be applied in industrial contexts.</p>
