Robin H. Johnson (robbat2) has been a Gentoo developer for nearly 10 years. Originally drafted because he was submitting too many patches & ebuilds and the existing devs got tired of applying all of them. Robin joined multiple teams as other developers had left, previously leading the PHP & MySQL teams before recruiting other developers to work them. This later lead Robin to join the council (2006-2007 term), Foundation (2009-present) & infrastructure (2003-present): Things were broken, and fixing them to scratch his own itch was the quickest way to make progress. He's committed to more than 25% of the tree, and maintains more than 2% of the tree.
