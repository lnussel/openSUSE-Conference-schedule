My name is Baltasar Ortega Bort (aka baltolkien). I'm 39 years old and I'm from Vila-real, a little town at north of Valencia and I'm a fan and a user of openSUSE distro & KDE Desktop. I'm a teacher from secundary level in a little school. I discovered Free Software, Linux, openSUSE and KDE in 2005, when I installed a OpenSuSE 9.3 in my PC, with a lot of problems with my usb modem. From this year all my computers (and a few of friends computers) have Linux Inside ( :) ) This hobby led three years ago that I launched to create a blog called KDEBlog (www.kdeblog.com), about the KDE desktop, their applications and their Distros (openSUSE is my favourite distribution, almost I use Kubuntu in my laptop. I want learn about the most distributions I can) in Spanish, one of my mother tongues, to reach the maximum of users in Spain and many Latin American countries.
