Frederic Crozat has been involved in Linux for 12 years, first as GNOME
maintainer for Linux-Mandrake and later a Engineering France team leader
at Mandriva. For 9 years, he was a member of GNOME Release Team. Since
mid 2010, he joined SUSE to work on various topics on SUSE Linux
distributions. During GNOME 3 development, he created a GNOME 3 live
image, based on openSUSE, to help people test GNOME 3 before it was
released. He maintains systemd for openSUSE (and integrated it in 12.1,
where it became default service manager), as well as lxc.
