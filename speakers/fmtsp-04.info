principles. As co-founder of Waag Society’s Fablab (a community fabrication laboratory) and the
Instructables Restaurant (an open source restaurant), he is an active member of the international
maker and digital fabrication community.</p>

<p>With a background in interaction design and a personal interest in electronics, Bas contributes to
projects both as a designer and a technical engineer. As head of the Open Design Lab he researches
the interface between production technologies and network cultures.</p>

<p>Some of Bas’s current initiatives include FairPhone (building world’s first fair mobile phone),
Fablab Suriname, and the (Un)limited Design Contest (an open source design contest). Bas is
co-editor of “Open Design Now”, a book on the transformation of design into an open discipline. In
this new paradigm, designs are shared and product innovation is a collaborative and world-spanning
process.</p>
