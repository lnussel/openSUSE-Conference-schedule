Andreas is 37 and in his daily life he is working at Regensburg University as an experimental physicist, doing research in the fascinating field of nano-electromechanical systems. For a long time he's been enthusiastic about Open Source and in particular Linux; since about two years he is in his free time contributing as a Gentoo developer. There, his activities are mirroring his "workplace environment": KDE, and TeX, some scientific software, Perl and printing stuff on the side.
