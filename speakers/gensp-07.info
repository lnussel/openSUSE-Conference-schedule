Fabian has been a Gentoo developer since 2005. His Linux adventures had started several years before joining Gentoo. After using Gentoo Linux for 4 years, he decided to get his first Mac in a useful state for development when he became a developer in the Gentoo/Alt team for the Gentoo for Mac OS X project. Ever since, he has worked on the successor of this project, what is today the successful Gentoo Prefix project. As database computer scientist, he can combine the Gentoo Prefix project with his work to empower most of the buildfarm machines running all kinds of UNIX. Currently, Fabian serves his second term on the Gentoo Council, a leading management body of the Gentoo project.
