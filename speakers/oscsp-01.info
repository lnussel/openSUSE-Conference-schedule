<p>Alexander started working for SUSE about 5 years ago. Since then he worked on fancy things like
mkinitrd, SUSE Studio, QEMU, KVM and ARM.</p>

<p>Whenever something really useful comes to his mind, he tends to implement it. Among others he did
Mac OS X virtualization using KVM, nested SVM, KVM on PowerPC and openSUSE for ARM. He is the
upstream maintainer of KVM for PowerPC, QEMU for PowerPC and QEMU for S390x.</p>
