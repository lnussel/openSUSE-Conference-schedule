My name is Nelson Marques and I live in the city of Aveiro (northern Portugal) where I also
currently work for Portugal Telecom Inovação S.A.. I've started using Linux back in 1998 and my
first distribution was SuSE Linux 5.2, which I followed up to 2004. In 2001 I've organized up that
point the biggest Linux promotion event in Aveiro, which became known as 'LIP Aveiro 2001' in the
Cultural Congress Center of Aveiro with the support of SuSE GmbH, Red Hat Inc., Sun Microsystems and
others.

On my professional life, I've worked with Linux for many years, and currently my role in PT Inovação
(former Center for Telecommunication Studies) is deeply connected to software packaging for a
popular Linux distribution. Besides this I also give training and support in packaging to the
developers who require it. I'm an avid defender of Linux on the Desktop and I'm working in bringing
MATE Desktop, Cinnamon and Unity to openSUSE, being that Cinnamon and MATE are available on
repository for testing and Unity is waiting for xorg-x11-proto to support Protocol 6.

I've participated in openSUSE Conference 2010 with a small talk about Marketing (which is my field
of credited expertise) and I'm happy to participate once more, though this time in a field which I
believe to be one of the most important for openSUSE as a Technological Community. And yeah, I do it
for the FUN!
