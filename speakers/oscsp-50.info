Tor Lillqvist has been hacking on Free and Open Source software for a 
long time, since before the term was invented. Often he has found 
himself porting software originating from mainstream Unix to more or 
less obscure platforms like RTE-A, Windows and Android. He has worked 
on LibreOffice and its predecessor for SUSE (and Novell before that) 
since 2006. Tor lives in Helsinki, Finland and is an atheist.
